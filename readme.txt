Take a break from selling by putting your WooCommerce shop on hold with vacation mode. Keep customers informed during vacations and holidays.

== Description ==
The Woo Store Vacation plugin is a perfect solution for online store owners who need to pause their business temporarily. Whether you need to take a break from managing your store or are unable to fulfill orders or respond to customer inquiries.

You can easily schedule a vacation period based on your local time. During this period, your shop will automatically pause, and customers will not be able to place new orders. However, your shop will reopen again at the beginning of the end date, ensuring that you don’t miss out on any potential sales or customers while you take a break. This feature provides you with peace of mind, knowing that your online store will resume normal operation automatically without any extra effort on your part. Additionally, if you decide to enable purchases during closing time, you can simply unselect the “Disable Purchase” checkbox. This allows customers to continue making purchases during your vacation period. With this feature, you have the flexibility to manage your online store based on your unique needs and circumstances.

The plugin is designed to have no negative impact on your site’s SEO. It does not add any meta tags, such as no-index, to your store, ensuring that your site’s search engine rankings are not affected while the vacation mode is activated. This means that you can confidently take time off without worrying about any negative effects on your online presence.

If you need to end your vacation early and want to reopen your store before the scheduled time, the plugin makes it simple to do so. You can easily deactivate the vacation mode whenever you want or reschedule the plugin to adjust your vacation period. This flexibility allows you to manage your online store with ease, knowing that you can make changes as needed.

The vacation notice feature lets you create a personalized automated message to inform users about important details while your shop is closed. You can include the start and return dates using smart tags `{{start_date}}` and `{{end_date}}`. Additionally, you can customize the notice’s color to match your site branding and add a call-to-action button that directs users to a specific page, like the contact page.

The vacation notice is initially visible on WooCommerce pages, including the shop and product pages. However, you have the option to add the notice to other pages on your site as well. If you use the core block editor or Gutenberg plugin, simply insert the Store Vacation Notice block to display the holiday message. For pages created with Elementor, use the Store Vacation Notice widget. Alternatively, in case you prefer the Classic Editor or other page builders like SeedProd or Divi Builder, you can use the `[woo_store_vacation]` shortcode to show the notice on any chosen page, such as the homepage, sidebar, or any other location.

If you have enabled the “Disable Purchase” option in the General settings, the plugin provides you with extensive customization options to tailor the availability of your shop during vacation mode. Take full control over your shop’s operations by excluding certain Products, Categories, Tags, Types of products, and Shipping Classes from being affected by the vacation mode.

With the intuitive interface, you can effortlessly specify which products should remain available for purchase, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for your customers even when your shop is in vacation mode. Maintain sales momentum by strategically selecting the items that will still be accessible while the rest of your inventory remains temporarily unavailable.

The plugin empowers you to fine-tune your shop’s behavior, granting you the flexibility to cater to your unique business requirements. Unlock the potential to maintain business continuity and customer satisfaction throughout your vacation.

To better distribute workload and responsibilities and create a collaborative environment for managing your online store, shop managers have access to the plugin settings to manage and edit vacation options.

This plugin is provided to handle multilingual sites with ease. It comes fully equipped with a configuration file to support WPML and Polylang plugins, making it translation-ready and easy to use for websites that cater to a global audience.

Overall, the Woo Store Vacation plugin is an essential tool for WooCommerce shop owners who need to take time off for personal or business reasons. By activating vacation mode, you can avoid negative reviews or damage to your reputation by providing clear communication to potential buyers about your availability and expected return date.
